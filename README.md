# bevy_boids
A simulation of a flock of birds in bevy. This project is inspired by the boids coding adventure [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw) by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague).

Boids follow three main rules:
1. Separation - steer away from nearby boids to avoid crashing into them
2. Alignment - steer to move in the same direction as nearby boids
3. Cohesion - steer towards the center of any nearby boids
